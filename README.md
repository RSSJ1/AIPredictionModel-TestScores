# AIPredictionModel-TestScores
Can a computer predict a test score using study time and sleep? In this project I trained a simple AI model using Thonny. 
# Project Title: AI Mini Project

## Problem
What problem were you trying to solve? Why does it matter?
I am trying to solve how to make my AI read data to be able to predict scores. This matters being able to help predict instead of having a person trying to predict.

## Solution
How does your project work? 
My project works by reeading a data sheet then gives out a prediction.
## Tools
Languages, libraries, datasets, or AI models used.
I used Thonny, but for my project to work it needed to have data to read which was used from a downloaded google sheet.
## Results - Output Screenshot
What worked? (accuracy, output, example, or result)
It gave out an actual output of a student test score who studies 6 hours.
## Learning
One important thing you learned from this project.
I learned I need to be aware with how I name my data in folders so my AI can read the data and give out a prediction.
